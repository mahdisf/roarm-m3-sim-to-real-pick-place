RoArm-M3 Pro Sim-to-Real Pick-and-Place with ROS2 + MoveIt | Advanced Robotics Project


YouTube Caption
In this project, we modeled and controlled the RoArm-M3 Pro robot arm using ROS2, MoveIt, and RViz, then transferred the same motion pipeline from simulation to the real robot.

What you will see:
- Kinematic modeling and workspace analysis
- Pick-and-place trajectory planning
- ROS2 custom node implementation
- Sim-to-Real execution on physical hardware

Excited to share our Advanced Robotics course project: a complete Sim-to-Real pipeline for the RoArm-M3 Pro robot arm using ROS2, MoveIt, and RViz.

We implemented kinematic modeling, trajectory planning, and a custom ROS2 node for repeated pick-and-place, then validated the same workflow on the real robot.
